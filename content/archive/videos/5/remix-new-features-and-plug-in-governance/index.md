title: "Remix New Features and Plug-in Governance"
description: "We’ve updated Remix’s architecture so that everything is a plugin.  We’ve invited developers out there in \"Ethereumland\" to make plugins to expand Remix’s functionality to address their uses cases.  This workshop will begin with introductions to some of these plugins.
Then together, we will go through tutorials using the NEW Remix tutorial framework, to learn the techniques needed to use these plugins."
