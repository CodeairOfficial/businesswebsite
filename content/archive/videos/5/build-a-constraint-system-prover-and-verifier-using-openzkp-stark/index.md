title: "Build a constraint system, prover and verifier using OpenZKP Stark"
description: "There are great tools and tutorials for R1CS proof systems (aka Snarks) but not much is known about programming Starks. Starks have a much more complex constraint language, but in return you can achieve a much better performance.
In this workshop we will
* learn about the mathematical underpinnings of Stark proofs,
* use 0x's OpenZKP library to generate and verify proofs, and
* implement a Stark constraint system."
