title: "Getting to a Million DApp Users"
description: "DApps are the future of the web but only thousands of people are currently aware of this future. How do we get millions of people to use DApps? Do they even need to know how DApps are different than other apps? Sid Coelho-Prabhu, Product Lead for Coinbase Wallet, will walk the audience through what is missing today in DApps and user interfaces, and how we can overcome these challenges. He will also cover how Coinbase Wallet enables both developers and users to leave behind what’s complicated about DApps and focus on what matters - developing products that add value to people’s lives all over the world."
