title: "Jaguar. Tinybox. Strawberry."
description: "It’s been nearly a year since the first wave of dapps, and while we’re still reeling with excitement, we’re also looking to the future. How do we bring the next generation of users to the decentralized world? How do we stop thinking in terms of thousands of users, and start thinking in millions and billions?We start thinking less about ourselves as developers, and more about the user experience. Until now we’ve been working around onboarding limitations, trying to create as smooth a UX as possible. A year later, and the time has come to stop overcoming limitations. We plan to remove them entirely.In this talk, we’ll focus on some of the biggest pain points that users face, how we’re solving them, and the impact those solutions will have on growing the ecosystem. We’ll explore parallels with previous big inflection points in tech, and how to draw on the past to help make decisions on where to go next. You’ll leave with invaluable tools, tricks, and strategies that will help you build your own successful dapps on the blockchain."
