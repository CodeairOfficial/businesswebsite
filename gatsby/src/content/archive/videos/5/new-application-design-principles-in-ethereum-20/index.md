title: "New Application Design Principles in Ethereum 2.0"
description: "With the Phase 0 spec freeze and Phase 1 in progress,  the mechanics of Casper FFG and  sharding of data availability has received plenty of attention. On the other hand, the mechanics of Ethereum 2.0 for application developers hasn’t received the same amount of clarity from the implementors nor scrutiny from the community. This talk will focus on how application design will (and will not!) evolve in the context of three trends in application design right now: DeFi, zero knowledge proofs, and layer 2 solutions."
