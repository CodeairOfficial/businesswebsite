title: "Blockchain Ã— 3D data, Publishing NFT for whole body 3D scanned data."
description: "The development and diffusion of VR and AR technology has made 3D data familiar.However, 3D data can be copied, and there are challenges in protecting copyrights and portrait rights. Also, monetization can be difficult.By publishing NFT of the original 3D data and providing the benefit that only the owner of the NFT can enjoy, we aim to create an eco-system that the value of the NFT will increase when the data duplicated.We(BlockBase,inc, DiGITAL ARTISAN, and MiraCreative) started a project to publish NFT of Whole body 3D scanned data of Japanese celebrities."
