    "description": "UltraPLONK is an extension of PLONK that supports custom gates and lookup arguments. In this talk, we introduce abstractions such as the \"matrix\" picture of the circuit, regions, and gates; then, we break these down to understand how they translate into polynomials that constrain a witness. We also explain optimisations, like floor-planning and selector combination, that improve the circuit layout.",
