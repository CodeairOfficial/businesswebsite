Any participants who do not make the top 20 bids will be funneled into a Raffle to win 1 of 80 tickets to Devcon VI. Each person who wins the Raffle will receive a ticket in exchange for paying the reserve price of a ticket.

One Raffle winner will be randomly selected to have their ticket be a Golden Ticket to Devcon VI, which means they will receive that ticket for Free.
