We’re excited to announce that Devcon VI will be held in Bogotá, Colombia's capital and largest city.

Our venue is the [Agora Bogotá Convention Center](https://goo.gl/maps/Ee3dz2XbQfbNKeR36); a newly constructed and state of the art venue that we hope will be, by far, the most suitable venue to ever host Devcon.

If you cannot attend Devcon VI in person in Bogotá, you can participate via Devcon Satellite Events! Devcon Satellite Events are an experiment to decentralize Devcon VI, to give the opportunity to foster a community amongst those who can’t make it to Bogotá due to distance, timing, costs, limited space, or other constraints, and to boost local Ethereum communities. 

You can learn more about Devcon Satellite events [here](/satellites).
