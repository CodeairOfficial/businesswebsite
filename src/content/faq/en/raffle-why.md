**Dogfooding**

At Devcon, we have a goal to dogfood built-on-ethereum tech as much as possible. It's a great opportunity to give the community hands-on experience using ethereum-based tech, it's a good opportunity to get feedback on ethereum-based projects, and it's more aligned with our ethos of decentralization and FOSS software.

A digital Auction and/or Raffle system that is censorship-resistant and independently-verifiable is a concept that, before Ethereum, wasn't really possible. It's also a mechanism that has many real-world use cases. Plus, building it on a layer 2 (rollup) allows users to experiment with rollups and feel first-hand their power (and decreased fees!).

**Provably fair & Provably efficient**

We like auctions because they figure out who wants an item the most, based on how high they are willing to pay for it. This is known as economic efficiency. But this is not the only way to allocate scarce items — and what about someone who really wants to attend Devcon, but can’t compete in the auction? For these folks, raffles are a simple and fair mechanism to draw winners at random.

With a hybrid mechanism, we get the best of both worlds. 20 tickets will serve the demand of those who just can't miss Devcon at any price, while 80 tickets are given out in a provably fair fashion, at face value.

**Alternate distribution mechanism**

Traditionally, we sell tickets in waves at several different days and times. This however inevitably ends up favoring some time zones more than others. In general, we think there must be better ways (or at least ways with different tradeoffs) to distribute tickets without asking people to wait and refresh a website at a certain time.
