title: DEV CON 0
description_old: "It all began in Berlin. Long prior to the launch of Ethereum, the earliest builders and co-founders gathered in Kreuzberg in late November of 2014 to outline their work and designs for the future of Ethereum at a meetup called 'ÐΞVcon-0'."
description: "Devcon 5 brought the Ethereum ecosystem together in Japan in October of 2019 for an event that featured more content and attendees than ever before. In addition to the conference talks, Devcon featured the event's first community run outdoor stage and experiential Park area, a powerful open from the City of Osaka, a celebrity appearance by the world’s most well-known dog, Kabosu (the original “Doge”) and so much more."
