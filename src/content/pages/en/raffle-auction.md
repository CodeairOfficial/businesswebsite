This year, with the help of the amazing TrueFi, we will be holding a pre-sale Raffle+Auction for **100** tickets to Devcon 6. The entirety of the Raffle+Auction will take place on Arbitrum.

Therefore, **we will only accept crypto** as a method of payment. We advise bridging funds to Arbitrum ahead of time if you wish to participate in the Auction/Raffle. The minimum bid required to participate in the auction will be the cost of a General Admission Devcon ticket in ETH. Everybody who participates in the Raffle & Auction will get a POAP NFT to indicate participation.
