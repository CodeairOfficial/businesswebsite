This year, with the help of the amazing TrueFi/TrustToken team, we will be holding a pre-sale Auction and Raffle for 100 tickets to Devcon 6. The entirety of the Auction and Raffle will take place on Arbitrum.

Therefore, we will only accept crypto as a method of payment. We advise bridging funds to Arbitrum ahead of time if you wish to participate in the Auction/Raffle. Everybody who participates in the Raffle & Auction will get a POAP NFT to indicate participation. The site for the Raffle & Auction can be found here.
