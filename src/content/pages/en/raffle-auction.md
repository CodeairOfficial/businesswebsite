title: Experimental On-chain Ticket Auction & Raffle

This year, we will be holding **a pre-sale Auction & Raffle for the first Devcon VI passes.** *Both the Auction & Raffle will take place on Arbitrum, a layer 2 rollup that settles on Ethereumâ€™s mainnet. Therefore, we advise [bridging funds to Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) ahead of time if you wish to participate - **ETH will be the only accepted form of payment**.*

The Ticket Auction will look similar to a traditional auction: Participants can submit bids and the 20 highest bidders will each receive a ticket to Devcon VI, in exchange for their bid amount. Any participants who do not make the top 20 bids will have another chance to win 1 of 80 tickets to Devcon 6 at the reserve price through a raffle! Everybody who participates in the Auction & Raffle will get a POAP NFT to indicate participation. And best of all, proceeds will be donated to public goods! 

*Thanks to the amazing developer team at TrueFi for donating their time and expertise to help us build this project.*

*Note: **Smart contract wallets like Argent & Gnosis safe will not be compatible with the Auction & Raffle this year**. We hope to amend the contracts in future iterations to allow us to accept these payment methods.*
