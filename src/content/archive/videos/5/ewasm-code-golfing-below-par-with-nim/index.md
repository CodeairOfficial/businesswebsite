title: "(e)WASM code golfing - below par with Nim"
description: "On the horizon of Ethereum2,  WebAssembly being proposed for phase 2 execution. Just like with the EVM, we'll be paying for gas and storage, and thus it's important that you're able to use contract space efficiently.In this presentation, we'll go over the WASM pipeline from program code to assembly bytecode, looking step by step at:* where storage goes* tricks and techniques  to optimize for size, speed or both* how the compiler looks at and reasons about  your code* what tooling is available to help you!* how the choice of programming language might affect the efficiency of your codeFor our examples, we'll be using NimPlay - an easy to use smart contract development environment currently being researched at Status."
