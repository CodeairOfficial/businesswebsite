title: "Beyond CryptoKitties: building tradeable, interoperable ERC721 digital assets"
description: "ERC721, a standard for non-fungible tokens pioneered by CryptoKitties, is the new standard on the block, somewhat less well understood than the more mature ERC20. ERC721 has a variety of emerging use cases, including pure collectibles, game items, event tickets, naming systems, and even physical assets like real estate. This workshop will guide participants through the process of creating a new ERC721 contract from start to finish, with functionality beyond simple collection and trading. It will cover a range of tools for building robust, useful ERC721 assets, including decentralized file systems like IPFS for metadata storage, integration with marketplaces like OpenSea, interoperability with virtual worlds like Decentraland and CryptoVoxels, ERC20-compliant wrapped ERC721's, and ties to off-chain data with Oracles like ChainLink. The workshop will leverage existing Ethereum infrastructure like Truffle and Infura, allowing the user to deploy a fully-functional ERC721 contract that could then be launched alongside a dapp on the Ethereum mainnet. The workshop will also discuss extensions to the ERC721 contract, as well as newer standards like ERC1155."
