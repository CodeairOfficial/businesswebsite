title: "Ask Not What Ethereum Can Do For Videogames; Ask what video games can do for Ethereum"
description: "Blockchain games have been described as the Trojan Horse for Ethereum mainstream adoption. This presentation takes a tactical approach to explaining why, and it includes a community call to action: develop a gaming strategy.
Video games are the fastest growing sector of the entertainment industry worldwide, and they are shaping our civilization in profound ways. The apps on our phone, social media platforms, and productivity suites we use for work have all benefited from the process of gamification. Quite literally, our expectations for how we believe the world should be organized are being shaped by video games. Even geopolitics have been ensnared by the gamified fabric of Twitter.
Ethereum is in pursuit of global adoption. And it is in direct competition with legacy systems: governments, corporations, special interests. Video games, while â€œfun," are inherently adversarial by design. The tech we develop for Ethereum games, therefore, must withstand highly adversarial conditions. Ergo, video games may be a covert breeding ground for radical tech development.
Hoard is currently in official partnerships or have had preliminary conversations with projects to develop their gaming strategies:
- OmiseGO -> Plasma
- Golem -> Distributed Computation
- Colony -> DAOs & Guilds"
