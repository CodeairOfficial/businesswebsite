title: "Creating Type Safe DApps with TypeScript and TypeChain"
description: "Lately, we've seen a huge spike in TypeScript popularity, wouldn't it be great to be able to leverage it for DApp development?In my talk, I want to show how to use TypeScript and tool that I created called TypeChain to achieve fully type-safe communication with Ethereum smart contracts. This speeds up development process, helps to find bugs in compile-time and warns about breaking changes.TypeChain is not only useful during DApp development but it integrates with Truffle Suite as well which makes writing tests for smart contracts in TypeScript possible."
