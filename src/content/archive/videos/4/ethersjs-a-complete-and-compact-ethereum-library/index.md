title: "ethers.js - A Complete and Compact Ethereum Library"
description: "The ethers.js library, which has received a DevEx Grant from the Ethereum Foundation is an Ethereum library designed to be complete, while remaining small, flexible and secure. By creating a library which abstracts many of the features available in the Ethereum eco-system to a collection of lowest-common denominator objects, developers can focus on the aspects they care aboutÂ for their application without having to take into account the type of signer (a geth node? a hardware wallet? a multi-sig contract) or the provider back-end (geth? parity? INFURA? Etherscan?)."
