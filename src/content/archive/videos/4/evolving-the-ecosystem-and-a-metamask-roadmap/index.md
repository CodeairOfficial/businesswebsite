title: "Evolving the Ecosystem & a Metamask Roadmap"
description: "The maturation of dApps has progressed significantly compared to two years ago, especially in being mobile-ready and end-user friendly. MetaMask has a story to tell about this progression first-hand and the new challenges that 2018 brings us. In this presentation we will alert the community about upcoming features from MetaMask such as IPFS support, signed type data, our new web3 injection model, MetaMask-as-a-light-client, mobile support, and multi-chain support. We will also take a critical look at how different actors are attempting to improve on the bridge between users and dApps that is the Ethereum browser."
