title: "Raiden Network: Getting to a production ready payment channel network"
description: "The Raiden Network is the payment channel network for Ethereum aiming to help scale Ethereum payment and all Dapps that utilize Ethereum for payments and rely on no on-chain side effects of the payments. There will be a small explanation of what is payment channels and a payment channel network, an explanation of the raiden network protocol and a demo of using Raiden (hopefully by then live on the mainnet). We will close with future plans, expansion of the protocol and showcasing potential applications."
