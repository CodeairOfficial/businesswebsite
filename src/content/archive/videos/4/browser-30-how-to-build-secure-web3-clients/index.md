title: "Browser 3.0 - How to Build Secure Web3 Clients"
description: "The Internet and Ethereum share many parallels. We can learn from the history of the Web and its \"browser wars\" and will see that \"time to market\" plays an important role for the positioning and adoption of network clients. The Chrome browser defines for most people how they use services and experience the Internet and a new generation of clients will eventually do the same for the Ethereum network. Applications such as Mist or Brave use popular frameworks like Electron to accelerate the development of browser(-like) applications without giving up platform ownership as it is the case for plugins such as Metamask. However, Electron has some serious security issues that should be considered and which are discussed together with their alternatives."
