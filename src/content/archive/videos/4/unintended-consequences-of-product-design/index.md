title: "Unintended Consequences of Product Design"
description: "The little choices we make when building a product—regardless of how much thought we put into them at the time—can have long lasting consequences. I'll cover lessons learned while building MyEtherWallet & MyCrypto, why we decided to ultimately make the hard choice to remove private keys from MyCrypto.com and move people to the desktop app, and how others can be more mindful while building great products in this ecosystem that promote a secure and decentralized mindset for both product creators, their teams, and ultimately their end users."
