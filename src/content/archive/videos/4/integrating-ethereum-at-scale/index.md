title: "Integrating Ethereum at Scale"
description: "Many developers understand how to integrate with the Ethereum blockchain with a few accounts, but how do you grow your product to support millions of users? Jake & Eric, engineering leads at Coinbase, will facilitate a roundtable discussion about the unique challenges of integrating with Ethereum at scale, including key management, protecting customer privacy, and building for forks. We hope this conversation will be a starting point for other major companies in the space to share how theyâ€™ve scaled and learn ways we can support each other to grow this industry."
