title: "The Decentralized Colllaborative Web"
description: "Since the early days of Ethereum and the blockchain 2.0 movement there has been extensive research regarding the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) concept. Nevertheless, and despite TheDAO experiment, a complete understanding of what exactly a DAO is and how its ticks is still lacking. In this talk Iâ€™d like to briefly sketch a comprehensive DAO protocol, enabling decentralised reputation-based collaboration, decision making and value distribution. A scalable implementation of the protocol on the Ethereum blockchain is made possible by introducing a novel software architecture composed of a simple smart contract on the chain, and an off-chain component responsible for the majority of the interactions with the protocol."
