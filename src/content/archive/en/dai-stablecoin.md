title: 'Dai Stablecoin'
featured: true
description: 'The process of developing the Dai Stablecoin System has matured significantly over the course of the last year. We innovated in the Ethereum community by being the first project to release a well-defined reference implementation, written in Haskell, for our proposed system. This effort has helped with the simplification of the systemâ€™s design, increased project efficiency, and has attracted the attention of formal verificiation specialists who now want to focus on Maker. It is becoming more and more likely that Maker will be the first non-trivial decentralized application to be formally verified before launch. In this proposed presentation, I would like to talk about the usefulness of rigorous specification and external reference implementations for the benefit of other Ethereum projects.'
speakers: 'Andy Milenius'
bios: 'Team Lead for MakerDAO, a project working on price-stable cryptocurrencies, and DappHub, an organization that specializes in formal verification and free software for dapps.'
