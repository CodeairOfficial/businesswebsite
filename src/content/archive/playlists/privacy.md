title: Privacy
description: These videos evaluate different projects and mechanisms that are working towards more privacy on the Ethereum network. The main technology used for privacy is called 'zero knowledge proofs' (ZKP). This technology allows for privacy by mathematically preventing certain information from being revealed to the public while the protocol can still guarantee the transaction executes correctly.
