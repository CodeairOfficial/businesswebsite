title: Devcon 5
description: "Welcome to Osaka! Devcon V was a unique and large gathering in Japan in October of 2019 that featured more content than ever before as the Ethereum ecosystem closed in on the launch of Eth2. In addition to the conference talks, Devcon featured the event's first outdoor stage and experiential Devcon Park area, a powerful open from the City of Osaka, a celebrity appearance by the worldâ€™s most well-known dog, Kabosu (the original 'Doge') and so much more."
