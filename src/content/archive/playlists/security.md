title: Security
description: Ethereum smart contracts are extremely flexible, capable of both holding large quantities of tokens (often in excess of $1B) and running immutable logic based on previously deployed smart contract code. While this has created a vibrant and creative ecosystem of trustless, interconnected smart contracts, it is also the perfect ecosystem to attract attackers looking to profit by exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts and unexpected behavior in Ethereum. Smart contract code usually cannot be changed to patch security flaws, assets that have been stolen from smart contracts are irrecoverable, and stolen assets are extremely difficult to track.
