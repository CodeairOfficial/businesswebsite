description: "In many ways, Devcon 3 was a celebration held around 'Dio de Los Muertos' and Halloween in Cancun, Mexico in October of 2016. It was the largest ever Ethereum gathering at the time, with just under 2000 attending in a year of unprecedented growth in terms of network use, adoption and progress."
