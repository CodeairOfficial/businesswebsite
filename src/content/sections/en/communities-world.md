  We could host Devcon in the same place every year, sure (heck – it would be way easier for our team). But we’re working toward achieving a goal of bringing Ethereum to communities around the world, and to places where it can have real impact **today**.

  Ethereum isn’t merely a technical solution, but a community. While blockchain communities in Europe and North America are already strong and vivid, we be most effective in newly developing communities.


  Over the past years, we’ve seen [young Ethereum communities sprouting in Latin America], and the potential growth is tremendous. This is why we are excited to bring Devcon to Colombia this year.
