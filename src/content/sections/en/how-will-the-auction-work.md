## How will the auction work?

We will begin taking bids on ___ at _am EST and bidding will close at _pm EST xx/xx/xxxx. The minimum bid required to participate in the Auction will be x ETH. The 20 highest bidders in the Auction will each receive a Voucher Code redeemable for 1 Free Ticket to Devcon 6. All funds/proceeds above the Reserve Price will be donated to X-Public-Good.

## How will the raffle work?

All Auction participants who do not make one of the top 20 bids will be funneled into a Raffle to win 1 of 80 tickets to Devcon 6. Each person who wins the Raffle will receive a Voucher Code redeemable for 1 Free Ticket Devcon 6. One Raffle winner will be randomly selected to have their ticket be a Golden Ticket to Devcon 6, which will grant that Raffle winner the ability to withdraw their funds from the Auction/Raffle contract, and still receive a Voucher Code that grants 1 Free Ticket to Devcon 6.

## Will I get my money back if I do not win the Auction or win the Raffle?

Yes, you will be able to withdraw your funds if you do not win either the Auction or Raffle (minus a 2% fee). Raffle winners will also be able to withdraw all funds above the Reserve price (minus a 2% fee).

## Reasoning

### Dogfooding

At Devcon, we have a goal to dogfood built-on-ethereum tech as much as possible. It's a great opportunity give the community hands-on experience using ethereum-based tech, it's a good opportunity to get feedback on ethereum-based projects, and it's more aligned with our ethos of decentralization and FOSS software. Traditionally, we sell tickets in waves at several different days and times.

### Provably fair & Provably efficient

One neat aspect of this mechanism is that one can tune how efficient vs. how fair one wants the distribution to be. With auctions being the most efficient form of scarce resource allocation, and Raffles being the most fair form. Twenty tickets allocated to the Auction and 80 tickets allocated to the Raffle (100 tickets in total) means the distribution is 20% efficient, 80% fair.

### Alternate distribution mechanism

This however inevitably ends up favoring some time zones more than others. In general, we think there must be better ways (or at least ways with different tradeoffs) to distribute tickets without asking people to wait and refresh a website at a certain time.
