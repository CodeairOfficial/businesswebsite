pages: ['about']
left: >-
  This year, we’re trying something new by finding new ways to support Ethereum-related public goods in lieu of a traditional Sponsorship program. 


  Aligned teams will have the opportunity to contribute toward Ethereum-related public goods to grow the Ethereum ecosystem, and further technologies that help us move forward together.

  As a thank you, we’ll be allocating Supporter Tickets to Devcon VI to those who give back to the community by supporting public goods that benefit Ethereum.If you’re building applications or infrastructure that benefits Ethereum and you’re interested in participating or learning more, [click here to inquire for more information!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcZuRlbp_cW0eKvqJ-4tRJfsfDCdEhNTnHFaITy9cmRUEfRQ/viewform) 


  *Supporter Tickets are tightly limited in availability, entities are subject to a review prior to participating in the Devcon Supporter round.*
