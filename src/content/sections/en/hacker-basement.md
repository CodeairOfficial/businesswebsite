Looking for a place where you can test all the new tech and build? This time, we got you covered!

_The hacker basement will be your high-focus zone away from the busy conference ado._

_It sets the right conditions for an individual to test new stuff on their laptop, to learn, or to hack on new ideas in a group._

_Everything a hacker needs will be taken care of: cozy seating, electricity and internet and, of course, cyberpunk lighting and low-fi beats to get you in the right mood to build!_
