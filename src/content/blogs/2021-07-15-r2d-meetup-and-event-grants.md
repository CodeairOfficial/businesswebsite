Community organizers are the glue that holds the Ethereum ecosystem together, and whether they're leading large-scale events, local meetups, hackathons or seminars, we might all be wandering in the dark forest of the analog world without them. But where's the fun in relying on chance encounters with kindred spirits identified by a telltale laptop sticker, or that indefinable air of cryptocool?

Although major events tend to generate more buzz, not everyone can travel halfway across the world for a conference. Smaller events play a crucial role in making Ethereum inclusive, accessible and cohesive: anyone with an internet connection and a laptop can participate in a virtual meetup or join an online hackathon team, and there are myriad opportunities at any given time.

With this in mind, the Devcon team is collaborating with [ESP](https://esp.ethereum.foundation) to host a round of grants of $500-1500 for meetups and small events. If you're organizing an event or series and need help covering associated costs, or have been putting off something special due to lack of resources, we're here for you! If your event doesn't have any associated costs but you're running into some other obstacle, feel free to get in touch anyway and we'll see if we can help. 

To be eligible for a grant, your event should be:

* Ethereum focused
* Free to attend
* Open to anyone
* If held in person, compliant with all local COVID-19 restrictions and guidance
* Not focused on investment, price or token sales
* Events that have already taken place are not eligible

We hope to hear from organizers of all kinds, from anywhere in the world. Regardless of whether you need support, any event that meets the criteria can participate - just submit the form to let us know you'd like to be listed on [devcon.org](https://www.devcon.org/en/#participate) and receive a special "Road to Devcon" badge to display on your website.

**Head [here](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/en/devcon-grants/) for more details and the submission form.**

This grant round is specifically targeted at small events with relatively minimal costs, with a streamlined application process. If your event doesn't fit the criteria or you're seeking larger sponsorships, you can always submit an [inquiry](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/en/inquire/) to ESP. ðŸ¦„
