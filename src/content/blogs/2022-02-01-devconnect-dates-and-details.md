_[In our last post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/13/announcing-devconnect/), we outlined Devconnect as a week-long gathering that will feature independent Ethereum events, which aim to bring the Ethereum community together in smaller groups to talk, learn about, or make serious progress on specific subjects. Learn more at [Devconnect.org](https://devconnect.org)_ 

## Announcing Devconnect Dates

**Save the date: Devconnect is scheduled to take place in Amsterdam between April 18-25 2022**. 

While we continue to closely monitor evolving COVID-measures in Amsterdam, things are progressing in the right direction, and we’re organizing quickly. With that, we wanted to share a lot more about what you’ll find in Amsterdam.

## By (and for) everyone: Devconnect’s Evolving Schedule
Let’s talk about content. Each event during Devconnect week will be independently hosted and curated by experts in different domains, as innovators look to continue to improve Ethereum. 

Keep in mind that we want Devconnect to be productive, which means smaller audiences for _some_ events, as relevant experts in these specific domains get to work. Most of these pieces, including ticketing, are up to the organizers of each session (not the Devconnect team). And we’ll keep our schedule updated over at [Devconnect.org](https://devconnect.org/) so that you can see further additions as they come together.

Oh(!), and there _will_ be space for everyone to collaborate, more on that in a moment!

**Which types of summits are on the calendar as of now? Here are just a few — check out the [Devconnect schedule](https://devconnect.org/schedule) for the full list!**

## Devconnect Co-Work

The Devconnect Co-Work is a place to work, and a space to relax. While all of the events happening throughout the week are independently organized, this co-working space will be officially hosted by the Devconnect team and features space to:

- Work: Tables, wifi, and outlets
- Relax: Comfy areas to relax alone or in a small group
- Collaborate: Several meeting rooms available for informal meetings (first come first serve)
- Energize: Light snacks and drinks will be offered throughout.

And most importantly, passes to the Co-Work are open to all Devconnect attendees looking to work together and hang out between sessions, so come meet with old and new friends alike.

## City Guide: Get to know Amsterdam

Before you fly, [check out our Amsterdam City Guide](https://devconnect.org/city-guide), where you can find information about the city, learn about how to get around, or find places to stay, eat, pay with tokens and more. 

Amsterdam is known as one of the world’s most multicultural cities. Like Ethereum, it can mean many things to many different people, and there’s something interesting for everyone. We hope you’ll find a few places to get started by using the guide. 

## Volunteer Call! Want to help?
Devconnect can't take place without a group of dedicated, passionate volunteers ready to help keep the show on the road.
