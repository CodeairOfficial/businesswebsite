Itâ€™s been a little while, and weâ€™ve got some news. 

## ðŸ‘‹  Itâ€™s happening! ðŸ‘‹

After being cooped up for the last years, it's exciting to finally say that **Devcon 6 will take place in the first half of Q4-2022 in Bogota, Colombia.** We know that Devcon has a special spot in everyoneâ€™s heart (ours too!), and we canâ€™t wait to share more information very soon (stay tuned!).

In the meantime, the Road to Devcon continues with another project that we've been working on recently.

## Meet a little something new

[*Devconnect*](https://devconnect.org/) is a week-long gathering in Amsterdam that will feature independent Ethereum events, each with a unique focus. The goal is to focus on depth-first sessions rather than size, and to bring the Ethereum community together in smaller groups to talk, learn about, or make serious progress on specific subjects.

Unlike a usual conference, we want this week-long gathering to facilitate the deep discussions and conversations that are needed to continue to improve Ethereum. Each discussion during Devconnect will be hosted and curated by experts in those domains. The EF will help foster coordination so that experts and teams have logistical and production help, and assurance that there's minimal overlap of similar domains to avoid pulling builders in different directions.

Most importantly, we want Devconnect to be productive! That means that, for all gatherings and workshops, we aim to have audiences that are relevant experts or those very interested in the specific domain. 

As for everyone coming to town and wanting to hang out and work together between sessions, we'll maintain a co-working space for collaboration for all who are interested.


### What can we achieve with a build-week?

With all of the new challenges the world is facing and the opportunities Ethereum is embracing, this year the EF decided to try something new.

It's been great to see that familiar major events have begun to return to action â€” meanwhile we've started to build Devconnect as something a bit different. Ideas for Devcon have been expanded upon and iterated on since we were together in Osaka, and while major events like Devcon remain the primary productive and incredible staple in our ecosystem, we hope that this new type of gathering can be complementary, and impactful in new ways.

## When can we learn more? 

**Stay tuned to [Devconnect.org](https://devconnect.org/), and to [@EFDevconnect](https://twitter.com/efdevconnect) on twitter** for more information on exact dates and locations soon, and to the EF blog. 

And if youâ€™re interested in hosting a Devconnect event, **[reach out](https://forms.gle/m5KWJ3aX5H3kTR7s6)**! We can't wait to get together in Amsterdam in April, and in Bogota later in 2022. See you all again soon.
