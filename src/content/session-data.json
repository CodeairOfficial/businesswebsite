    "description": "Everyone hears ‚ÄúNFT‚Äù and thinks jpegs, but we‚Äôre at the beginning of something spectacular. With NFTs, our ability to assess ownership transparently and privately means that web services can verify users (and their data) without having to rely on the surveillance economy business model. Instead of being the product, users are able to access the product via the economics programmed into their NFTs. Users get more control over how their data is used, monetized, shared and more.",

Without credit, these farmers cannot expand their farms nor increase their incomes. However, the blockchain ecosystem has amassed over $80 billion in total value locked across DeFi protocols that don't support pragmatic financing. \"Decentralized Microfinance\" proposes a structure on how to leverage DeFi to expand access to financial services to REAL underserved communities.",
